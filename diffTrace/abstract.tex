We present a tool called
DiffTrace that approaches debugging via {\em whole program} tracing and
diffing of typical and erroneous traces.
%
After collecting these traces,
a user-configurable front-end filters out irrelevant function calls
and then summarizes loops in the retained function
calls based on state-of-the-art loop extraction algorithms.
%
Information about these loops is inserted 
into concept lattices, which we use to
compute salient dissimilarities to narrow down bugs.
%
DiffTrace is a clean start that addresses
debugging features missing in existing approaches.
%
Our experiments on an MPI/OpenMP program called
ILCS and initial measurements on LULESH, a DOE miniapp,
demonstrate the advantages of the proposed debugging approach.
