\chapter{Automated Concurrency Testing Framework for Go}
\label{sec:ch4}

This chapter is based on the work submitted to the 2021 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC).
We present \goat, a combined static and dynamic concurrency testing
and analysis tool that facilitate the process of debugging for real-world programs.
%
Key ideas in \goat include
1) automated dynamic tracing to capture the behavior of concurrency primitives,
2) systematic schedule space exploration to accelerate the bug occurance
and 3) deadlock detection with supplementary visualizations and reports.
We also propose a set of coverage requirements that characeterize the dynamic behavior of concurrency primitives and provide metrics to measure the quality of tests.
%
Our evaluation on 68 curated real-world bug scenarios
demonstrates that GoAT is significantly effective in detecting
rare bugs, and its schedule perturbation method based on schedule
yielding detects these bugs with less than three yields.
%
These results together with the ease of deploying GoAT on real-world
Go programs holds significant promise in field-debugging of Go programs.
