%%% The student-specific front matter fields are defined here:

\author                 {Saeed Taheri}
\title                  {Tools for Debugging and Analysis of Concurrent Programs}
\thesistype             {dissertation}

\dedication             {For my family}

%%% Most students need just a short degree name, like this:
\degree                 {Doctor of Philosophy}
%%% However, multiline degrees are possible, and are done like this:
%%% \degree                 {Doctor of Philosophy \\
%%%                         in \\
%%%                         Mathematical Physics}

%%% College- and Department-level definitions:
\approvaldepartment     {Computer Science}
\department             {School of Computing}
\graduatedean           {David B. Keida}
\departmentchair        {Mary Hall}

%%% The graduate student's committee members:

\thirdreader            {Alexander Lex}
\fourthreader           {Martin Burtscher}
\chairtitle             {Professor}

%%% NB: It is rare, but possible, for there to be two chairs, For
%%% example, one student had
%%%
%%% \committeechair{\mbox{\small Andrej Cherkaev and Andrejs Treibergs}}
%%%
%%% The \mbox{} ensures that line breaks cannot happen, and the \small
%%% is necessary to make the names fit on the Dissertation Approval form

%%% The choice of bibliography style is a major decision, jointly made
%%% by you, your thesis advisor and the thesis editor. Common choices are
%%% one of the four standard BibTeX styles (abbrv, alpha, plain, and unsrt),
%%% or enhanced styles like acm, amsplain, siam, and hundreds of others
%%% available in TeX Live, and other Unix and Windows TeX distributions.
%%%
%%% Do NOT handcode your reference list, because you are unlikely to
%%% achieve consistency or conformance to the University of Utah Thesis Office
%%% requirements: let BibTeX do that tedious job for you!
%%%
%%% Remember that reference-list metadata in BibTeX files remains
%%% constant across journals and publishers, and is are often reused
%%% in other documents and shared with others, whereas formatted
%%% reference-list styles change: with BibTeX, you only need to record
%%% the metadata once.
%%%
%%% If you prefer named, rather than numeric or tagged citations, you
%%% may use styles such as authordate{1,2,3,4}, chicago, harvard, or
%%% natbib.  Be aware, however, that most of those require an
%%% additional \usepackage{} command to supply \LaTeX{} with
%%% definitions of commands that the style needs, and that there are
%%% usually several flavors of LaTeX citation commands beyond the
%%% standard \cite{} command that you need to understand before you
%%% can use them properly in your prose.

%%% This tells BibTeX to read siam.bst from the first directory where
%%% it is found in the BSTINPUTS search path:

\bibliographystyle{siam}

%%% This can also specify a comma-separated list (without embedded
%%% spaces) of *.bib files found by BibTeX in its BIBINPUTS search
%%% path.  The argument \jobname means the base name of the top-level
%%% LaTeX file, avoiding an unnecessary filename dependence here.
%%%
%%% BibTeX writes only one .bbl file, no matter how many *.bib files
%%% are listed here, using the name \jobname.bbl.
%%%
%%% LaTeX reads BibTeX's formatted reference list from the file
%%% \jobname.bbl.

\bibliography{\jobname}
